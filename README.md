This code solves the 3b1b's [lady bird problem](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/t3jZ2xGOvYg) by simulation, btw if your name is Grant Sanderson and you are watching this then the color is not red its orange dude.


Ohh guys lets run the code

Hmmm
Results:-
```
Current node: 8
Loop counts: 104669
Counts: {1: 9617, 2: 9533, 3: 9544, 4: 9452, 5: 9385, 6: 9582, 7: 9509, 8: 9565, 9: 9562, 10: 9436, 11: 9484, 12: 0}
Probablity: {1: 0.0918801173222253, 2: 0.09107758744231817, 3: 0.09118268064087744, 4: 0.09030371934383628, 5: 0.08966360622533892, 6: 0.09154572987226399, 7: 0.09084829319091613, 8: 0.09138331311085422, 9: 0.09135465132942897, 10: 0.09015085650956826, 11: 0.09060944501237234, 12: 0.0}
```

hmm it turns out every number has about aproxx 9% chance 
and its very surprising that 12 will never come idk why maybe Grant will tell the answer in his video :)
